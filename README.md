This repository contains the source code used in the study
“Dual Machine Learning Pinpoints the Radius of Informative Structural Environments in Metallic Glasses.”

The codebase is organized into two complementary machine-learning pipelines that operate on the same atomic-scale dataset but follow different modeling philosophies. Together, they are used to identify the Radius of Informative Structural Environments (RISE) in metallic glasses.

The atomic configuration dataset used in this work is publicly available on Zenodo:
